// Apparently, when Awesomium was first created, the programmers did not understand that someone would
// eventually want to post data from the application.  So they made it incredibly difficult to upload
// POST parameters to the remote web site.  We have to jump through hoops to get that done.
//
// This module provides that hoop-jumping in a simple-to-understand fashion.  We hope.  It overrides
// the current resource interceptor (if any), replacing both the OnRequest and OnFilterNavigation
// methods (we aren't using the latter yet).
//
// It also provides settable parameters.  Once this module is attached to the WebCore, it is *always*
// attached; therefore, we can simply change the parameters before posting to the web site.
//
// File uploads are currently unhandled, and, once handled, will probably only upload one file.  We
// will deal with that issue later.
//
// To incoroprate this into your application, follow these steps:
//  1.  Add this file to your project.  You know how to do that.
//  2.  Edit your MainWindow.cs file.
//      a.  At the top, add:
//              using CRI;
//      b.  inside the main class declaration, near the top, add:
//              private CustomResourceInterceptor cri;
//      c.  In the MainWindow method, add:
//              WebCore.Started += OnWebCoreOnStarted;
//              cri = new CustomResourceInterceptor();
//          and (do this *before* you set the Source value for the Web Control):
//              cri.Enabled = true;
//              cri.Parameters = String.Format("login={0}&password={1}", login, pw);
//          (Choose your own parameters, but format them like a GET query.)
//      d.  Add the following method:
//              private void OnWebCoreOnStarted(object sender, CoreStartEventArgs coreStartEventArgs) {
//                  WebCore.ResourceInterceptor = cri;
//              }
//  3. Compile your application.  It should work.
